# Face-Attendance-project-FAP-
The Face Attendance Project is a smart attendance system that uses facial recognition technology to automatically mark student attendance. Instead of using a manual register or RFID card, this project scans a person's face using a webcam and marks their attendance by matching the face with saved data.
